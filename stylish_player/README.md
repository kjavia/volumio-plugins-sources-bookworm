# Stylish Player Plugin

Volumio Plugin to show currently playing screen in with animated players, controls, and visualizations on the display (external or internal)

Requires a screen attached ot device, or external device with screen capable of loading <http://volumio.local:3339> (or a different user configurable port), which is different than the Volumio itself. For best results, use a Full HD or higher resolution screen, with touch capabilities.

### Peppy settings

The **Peppy** section in Stylish Player settings contains meter and spectrum pack
uploads and pack/model selection. Choose the active visualization separately in
**Player Configuration**.

- **Needle Sensitivity** sets the meter gain multiplier from 0.1 to 5.0 (default
  0.5). Higher values increase needle movement; the output is capped at full scale.
- **Smoothness** sets the averaging window from 1 to 30 frames (default 6).
  Higher values produce smoother but slower movement. A value of 1 disables averaging.

Both controls apply to all Peppy Meter views and are saved on the server. They do
not change Peppy Spectrum behavior.
